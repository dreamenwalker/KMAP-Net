# KMAP-Net
1. This is a multi-task framework for survival prediction of lung and gastric cancers.
2. The multi-task include tumor stage, node stage, and survival prediction tasks.
3. Datasets used in this study includes one public lung cancer study[1]
4. The main survial net is showed in "attentionNet1117debug1.py'.
5. Training and preprocessing is performed using "trainattention1120.py".
